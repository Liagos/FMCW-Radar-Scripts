# Sensor Data Evaluation and Fusion for Automatic Door Management

This repository contains the code for the project "**Sensor Data Evaluation and Fusion for Automatic Door Management**". The goal of this project is to build a prototype system for intelligent door management.

The repository is organised as follows:
- The `AcquireRadarData.m` file configures the radar to transfer data to a PC host.
- The `TakeMeasurementData.m` file captures frames from the Radar sensor and images from the Camera module.
- The `Test_read_Data2.m` file evaluates the sensor measurements.
- The `plotData.m` file compares the data acquired from the Radar and the Camera.
