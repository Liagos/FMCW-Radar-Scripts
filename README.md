# FMCW-Radar-Scripts

In order to collect the data we use the AcquireRadarData script where we configure the radar to transfer data seamlessly to a PC host.

The TakeMeasurementData script is used to capture frames from the Radar sensor and image from the Camera module.

We then evaluate our measurements with the Test_read_Data2. 

Lastly, we compare the Radar and Camera data with the plotData script.
