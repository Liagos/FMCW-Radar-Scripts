# Sensor Data Evaluation and Fusion for Automatic Door Management

This repository contains the code for the project "**Sensor Data Evaluation and Fusion for Automatic Door Management**". The goal of this project is to build a prototype system for intelligent door management.

The repository is organised as follows:
- The `AcquireRadarData.m` file configures the radar to transfer data to a PC host.
- The `TakeMeasurementData.m` file is used to capture frames from tha Radar sensor and image from the Camera module.
- The `Test_read_Data2.m` file is used to evaluate our measurments
- The `plotData.m` file is used to compare the data acquired from the Radar and the Camera.
