# Sensor Data Evaluation and Fusion for Automatic Door Management

This repository contains the code for the project "**Sensor Data Evaluation and Fusion for Automatic Door Management**". The goal of this project is to collect, process, and visualize diverse sensor data in order to help humans monitor their surroundings.

The repository is organised as follows:
- The ***AcquireRadarData*** file is used to configure the radar in order to transfer data seamlessly to a PC host.
- The ***TakeMeasurementData*** file is used to capture frames from tha Radar sensor and image from the Camera module.
- The ***Test_read_Data2*** file is used to evaluate our measurments
- The ***plotData*** file is used to compare the data acquired from the Radar and the Camera.

|-------------------------------------|

In order to collect the data we use the AcquireRadarData script where we configure the radar to transfer data seamlessly to a PC host.

The TakeMeasurementData script is used to capture frames from the Radar sensor and images from the Camera module.

We evaluate our measurements with the Test_read_Data2. 

Lastly, we compare the acquired Radar and Camera data with the plotData script.
